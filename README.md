# KAMK Thesis Template for Typst

This repository is heavily inspired by the [WUT diploma thesis template](https://github.com/fuine/wut-thesis-typst) by Warsaw University of Technology in how the files are organized and named.

## Installing the Required Font (IF NEEDED)

**NOTE** that as of now, I am using the standard Libertinus Serif. To my eye, it looks 100x better than the crappy Calibre. Easier to read, too.

The KAMK thesis template relies on **Calibri** to match the official Word template. Because Calibri is a proprietary Microsoft font, Linux and macOS users should use **Carlito**, a free, metric-compatible alternative created by Google. Typst is configured to automatically fall back to Carlito if Calibri is not found.

### On Ubuntu

Follow these steps to install Carlito on Ubuntu:

1. Open your Terminal (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`).
2. Update your package list and install the font by running:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install fonts-crosextra-carlito
    ```
3. Update the font cache by running:
   ```bash
   fc-cache -f -v
   ```

### On macOS

Follow these steps to install Carlito on macOS:

```bash
brew install --cask font-carlito
```
